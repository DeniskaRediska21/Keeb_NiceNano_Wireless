# Split Ergo Ortholinear Hotswap Keyboard based on supermini_nrf52840 (NiceNano clone) with Choc switches

This project attempts to create easelly reproducible split ortholinear hotswap mechanical
keyboard. 

Gimmics: 
+ This design doesn't require any diodes
+ Uses supermini_nrf52840 as MC, runs on CircuitPython
+ Key layouts are changed by dragging a file onto MC's storrage
+ Halves are connected through BLE
+ Conencts to PC through both BLE and wire
+ PCB fits into 100x100mm square, so it is very cheap to order from Chineese manifacturers
+ Uses Choc switches
